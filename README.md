# Professional Portfolio for [Triskelion Flagship, LLC](https://tflagshipllc.com)

> **Note:** This repo is public only because [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart) requires it. If you want to build your own portfolio, please use [ashutosh1919's portfolio template](https://github.com/ashutosh1919/masterportfolio) instead.

This repo is a heavily customized version of the above template, with:
- Improved styling for âš¡ emoji bullet points
- Graceful error handling for missing values
- Improved secrets management (Bitwarden SM)
- CI/CD automation via GitHub Actions (with Slack notifications)
- Split-branch deployment (source and static content separated)
- Brand asset copyright licensing

I've disabled the _"Competitive Sites"_ and _"Open Source"_ sections, as they're much less relevant to my value proposition.

Feel free to browse, but I don't recommend cloning this repo unless you really want to see my tweaks!
