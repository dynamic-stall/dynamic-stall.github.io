- I've made a few updates, however; such as graceful error handling of missing values, improved secrets management, CI/CD automation via GitHub Actions, and separation of source code and build code via branched deployments.

- This repo is only public becasue [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site) requires a public repo at free-tier... I recommend you clone [ashutosh1919's portfolio template](https://github.com/ashutosh1919/masterportfolio); but I can't stop you, LOL!

- The GHA workflow is quite handy, if you'd like to adopt a similar workflow for your own portfolio.
